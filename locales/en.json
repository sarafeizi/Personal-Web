  "description": "I am always interested in learning and always trying to find new opportunities to grow and improve. Music, especially piano, fascinates me. The colors green, lilac, and sky blue make me feel relaxed. I love trying new foods and am always looking for new flavors. Yoga is also one of my hobbies and I try to attend classes regularly. Programming and psychology are two areas that really interest me. Nature and natural environments are very important to me, especially the sea, the forest, and the rainy weather. I am 25 years old and was born on April 4, 1999, and I currently live in Tehran",
